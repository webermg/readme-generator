## Description

This is a utility for generating readmes. Upon execution the program will prompt the user for information and use that to generate an appropriate readme for the project. Readmes generated will be in an output folder and will have a raw timestamp appended to them. The readme will contain a title, description, table of contents, and questions section with optional installation, usage, test, contribution, and license sections.
